## AgencyAnalytics Frontend React Challenge!

Below are the pieces of technology that we have added into this repository for you with a little description.

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The whole app will be built on this, feel free to check out the docs!

[PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/ ) this is the definitive API for all things Pokemon. You will be using this for all of our data during this challenge. So please dig in and give it a test, it doesnt require an API key so you can run api calls directly in browser to test out the responses. 

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) Bootstrap is a very popular UI/UX library it comes loaded with a lot of helpful aids and tools for you to use in this project.

Mockup is located in the /mockup folder

### The challenge will have you build a fully functioning react application that is designed to be a a bit of a "pokedex"

There are two pages:

## Page 1 ##
The home page. As the mockup suggests there are all of the following on the home page:
- A search bar where you can search for Pokemon
- The home page is paginated
- The layout is quite simple as far as showing the pokemon and their images.

## Page 2 ##
The second page is a detail screen for the Pokemon, on this page we just show details about each pokemon. This page is quite simple implement it based on the mockup!

TIP:
Notice how each page keeps a relatively similar "layout" across all views. This should help streamline the work!
